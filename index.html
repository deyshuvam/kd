        <p class="p2">
            There is nothing much to say about you <br>
            As there is nothing literally nothing <br>
            That is left for you to know <br>
            About me and my life <br>
            And how much I value you in my life <br>
            But still if you think that <br>
            There's something left for you to know <br>
            And as I am unaware of it .. <br>
            Please don't ask any more <br>
            Snatch the words yourself <br>
            From the lips of your truest lover ..

        <p class="p3">
            No one love you like I love ya<br>
            Never cheat, never lie<br>
            Never put no one above ya<br>
            I gave you space and time<br>
            And now you're telling me you miss it<br>
            And I'm still on your mind<br>
            We are one in a million<br>
            And love is hard to find<br>
            Do you stay up late, just so you don't dream?<br>
            Every time your lips touch another<br>
            I want you to feel me<br>
            I want you to feel me<br>
            Every time you dance with somebody<br>
            I want you to feel me<br>
            I want you to feel me<br>
            Do your days get a little bit longer?<br>
            Nights get a little bit colder?<br>
            Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
            Hah ah ah ah oh (do you feel me?)<br>
            Days get a little bit longer? (Feel me)<br>
            Nights get a little bit colder? (Feel me)<br>
            Heartbeat a little bit louder?<br>
            Feel me feel me
